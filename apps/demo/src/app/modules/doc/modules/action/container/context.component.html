    <!-- Examples -->
    <doc-feature-example header="dbx-action" hint="Primary action directive that sets up an action context.">
      <dbx-action-example-tools #action="action" dbxAction [action]="action">
        <p>There are several states to an action.</p>
        <p>The first is Idle. This action is waiting for the "trigger" event.</p>
        <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.trigger()">Trigger</button>
        <p class="dbx-warn" *ngIf="action.sourceInstance.isDisabled$ | async">The action is disabled.</p>
        <p>The second state is "triggered". This state instructs any listeners waiting for this to gather data that will be passed to the action. If ReadyValue is called before the "triggered" state is reached, it is ignored.</p>
        <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.readyValue('abc')">Ready Value ('abc')</button>
        <p>After a value is readied, the state is updated to "valueReady", which instructs any listeners to perform the action using the passed value.</p>
        <p>Working can be set at any time, regardless of the current state, allowing for cases where we may have an action that fires off immediately without waiting for a trigger.</p>
        <button mat-raised-button (click)="beginWorking(action)">Begin Working</button>
        <p>The working state can be resolved or rejected, similar to promises.</p>
        <p>These states can also be set at any time, regardless of the current state.</p>
        <div>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="stopWorking(action, true)">Resolve Successfully</button>
          <dbx-button-spacer></dbx-button-spacer>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="stopWorking(action, false)">Reject With Error</button>
        </div>
        <p>The state also provides the number of errors since the last success: {{ action.sourceInstance.errorCountSinceLastSuccess$ | async }}</p>
        <h4>isDisabled and disabledKeys</h4>
        <p>Actions have an additional state: isDisabled</p>
        <p>This is a computed state, based on the current number of "disabledKeys" within the action. This lets us know why an action is disabled. This disabled flag is only for blocking the triggered and readyValue states. We can begin working or resolve/reject without issue.</p>
        <div>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.disable('example')">Disable</button>
          <dbx-button-spacer></dbx-button-spacer>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.disable('example_2')">Disable (Key 2)</button>
          <dbx-button-spacer></dbx-button-spacer>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.enable('example')">Enable</button>
          <dbx-button-spacer></dbx-button-spacer>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.enable('example_2')">Enable (Key 2)</button>
        </div>
        <p>Disabled Keys: {{ action.sourceInstance.disabledKeys$ | async }}</p>
        <h4>isModified</h4>
        <p>Actions has an additional flag: isModified.</p>
        <p>isModified is used in some cases where the data we are providing may not be different. For example, updating a model on a server. This flag is generally set prior to trigger being called.</p>
        <div>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.setIsModified(true)">Set Modified</button>
          <dbx-button-spacer></dbx-button-spacer>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="action.setIsModified(false)">Set Not Modified</button>
        </div>
        <h4>Loading State</h4>
        <p>A loading state is available that represents the action.</p>
        <p>Loading State: {{ action.sourceInstance.loadingState$ | async | json }}</p>
        <p>Loading State Type: {{ action.sourceInstance.loadingStateType$ | async }}</p>
        <dbx-content-border>
          <dbx-label>dbx-loading with dbxActionLoadingContext</dbx-label>
          <dbx-loading dbxActionLoadingContext>
            <p>Success view.</p>
          </dbx-loading>
        </dbx-content-border>
        <p>There are various integrations with other components, including dbx-form, dbx-error, loadingState, interactions, etc.</p>
        <button mat-raised-button color="warn" (click)="action.reset()">Reset Action</button>
